it generates a list of continuous dates between one date and another later currently in greek and italian 
but it can easily changed to support any language
it might be useful if you don't want to use excel or open office to generate dates in a column... 
and you just want to use date ranges in a shell script in any language...
it takes dates in the format Year-month-day (ex. 2010-01-01 ) also you can type 10-01-01
and it prints dates in the format Day-Month-Year
